I've proposed this web app idea to my group, we built it from scratch, and successfully delivered the product on time. 
The web application would help crowd bars to reduce idle time for customers to buy drinks. The website provides images and descriptions about beers, cocktails, wines and champagnes and so on. Once customers chose drinks, then they have options to choose favorite glassware, add to shopping cart and make payment. The system take credit/debit card to process transactions automatically.
